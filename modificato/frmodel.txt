What is 'frmodel'?
  'frmodel' simulates motion of a Galactic source due 
to the Galactic rotation, the annual parallax and the 
solar motion. The Galactic rotation is assumed to follow 
the simple Flat Rotation Model(FRM).


How to get them?
  You can find a tar+gz package 'FlatRot.tgz' in 'Cybose' --> 
'Bunsho-kanri' --> 'VERAbunsho' --> 'Tools' --> 'FlatRot'.
After downloading and unpacking it as

  tar xvfz FlatRot.tgz ,

you will get a directory 'FlatRot' where you will find an 
executable program 'frmodel'. Or, if you are not a Linux 
user, you can compile them using Make files as

  make -f frmodel.mk .


How to use it?

  Type ./frmodel in a directory where you stored the 
executable program.

  Then, you will be asked about the coordinates of the 
source. The epoch of the equinox point is not asked 
since it could be left arbitrary for the rough simulation 
purpose. 

  Next, you will be asked if you have an estimated value
of the distance to the source. If you answer 'y', then
you will be asked to enter the estimated distance value.
If you answer 'n', then you will be asked to enter the
radial velocity value of the source. In the latter case,
the distance to the source is estimated based on the FRM.
If the source is located in the inner part of the Solar
Circle, two distance values are derived.

  If your source is too far from the Galactic plane or
your radial velocity is out of the range allowable in the 
FRM, an error or warning message will be issued.

  Then, some relevant parameters will be displayed as 
shown in the following example. Also a gnuplot script file 
will be generated for plotting the simulated trajectory of 
the source. If you have both 'gnuplot' and 'gv', the 
simulated trajectory will appear on your screen.

  If you wish to improve your figure by changing titles or 
aspect ratio, you could edit the gnuplot script file 
'frmodel.gp'.
